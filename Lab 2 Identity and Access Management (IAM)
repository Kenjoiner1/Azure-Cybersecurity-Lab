# Week 2: Identity & Access Management (IAM) Lab

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this lab was to strengthen the security of the Azure environment by implementing **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** best practices using **Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)**. Identity is the new security perimeter in cloud environments, so this lab focused on creating users, groups, and roles; enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); and configuring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR).

## 🛠️ Lab Tasks

### 1. Users

* Created three distinct **test users** in Azure Entra ID:

  * `AdminUser` – intended for privileged operations.
  * `SecurityAnalyst` – for monitoring and investigation tasks.
  * `TestUser` – for validating policies and simulating a standard user.

### 2. Groups

* Created the following **groups** to manage access at scale:

  * `SecurityTeam` – for administrators and security engineers.
  * `Developers` – for application and workload development roles.

### 3. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

* Applied **role assignments** at the **Resource Group level** (`CyberLab-RG`).
* RBAC mapping:

  * `SecurityTeam` → **Contributor** role (modify resources).
  * `Developers` → **Reader** role (read-only access).
  * `AdminUser` retained **Owner** role for lab administration.

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

* Enabled **MFA** for `AdminUser` and `SecurityAnalyst` accounts.
* Tested login workflows to validate that MFA was enforced.

### 5. Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)

* Enabled **SSPR** for the `SecurityTeam` group.
* Configured authentication methods (e.g., phone number + secondary email).
* Tested password reset process from a user perspective.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** RBAC roles were scoped to the **resource group** level instead of the subscription level to minimize overexposure.
* **Scalability:** Assigning roles to **groups** (not individual users) allows easier and more consistent access control.
* **Zero Trust Alignment:** MFA ensures stronger protection against compromised credentials.
* **Operational Efficiency:** SSPR reduces dependency on administrators and enhances user experience.

Example:

```
[Users] → [Groups] → [Roles] → [Resource Group]
   AdminUser → SecurityTeam → Contributor → CyberLab-RG
   SecurityAnalyst → SecurityTeam → Contributor → CyberLab-RG
   TestUser → Developers → Reader → CyberLab-RG
```

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Learned how to manage **users, groups, and roles** effectively in Azure Entra ID.
* Reinforced the importance of **least privilege** by scoping RBAC at the correct level.
* Improved security posture with **MFA** while enhancing usability with **SSPR**.
* Established a stronger identity foundation for the next lab on **security monitoring with Azure Sentinel**.
