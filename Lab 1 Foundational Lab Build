Lab 1: Azure Environment Setup
🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab was to create a foundational Azure environment that will act as the baseline for upcoming security projects. This setup provides a controlled environment where I can practice building secure cloud infrastructure and layer additional security controls in future weeks (IAM, Sentinel, SIEM integration, Zero Trust, etc.).

🛠️ Lab Tasks
1. Azure Free Tier Account

Signed up for the Azure Free Tier subscription.

Verified access to baseline services (Resource Groups, VNets, VMs, NSGs).

2. Resource Organization

Created a Resource Group: CyberLab-RG.

Used resource tagging (e.g., Environment=Lab, Owner=KennethJ) for better management and cost tracking.

3. Virtual Network (VNet) Setup

Deployed a Virtual Network: CyberLab-VNet (10.0.0.0/16).

Created two subnets:

Management Subnet (10.0.1.0/24): Used for administration tasks (Windows VM).

Workload Subnet (10.0.2.0/24): Used for workloads and experiments (Linux VM).

4. Virtual Machines (VMs)

Windows Server 2022 VM: prepared for future Active Directory + Sysmon labs.

Ubuntu Linux VM: prepared for logging agent deployment (Winlogbeat/Filebeat) and security monitoring.

Used Standard_B1s size to remain within Free Tier eligibility.

5. Network Security Groups (NSGs)

Created an NSG for each subnet.

Applied inbound rules with principle of least privilege:

Allowed RDP (3389) to Windows VM only from my IP.

Allowed SSH (22) to Linux VM only from my IP.

Denied all other inbound traffic by default.

🔐 Security Considerations

Least Privilege: Inbound access restricted to a single trusted IP.

Segmentation: Different subnets for management vs workload.

Defense-in-Depth: Future labs will add monitoring (Azure Sentinel, Wazuh), identity hardening, and automated incident response.

Tagging: Applied tags to track ownership and purpose of resources.
